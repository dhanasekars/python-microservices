`Time Spent : 45 minutes`

:thumbsdown: tried to restructure data, reading from a json file and parsing.
Learned the problems of circular import, could not find the right solution but learnt why it is not working
Also, learn to rebase to last working version

This will undo any changes you've made to tracked files and restore deleted files:
```commandline
git reset HEAD --hard
```
This will delete any new files that were added since the last commit:
```commandline
git clean -fd
```
Files that are not tracked due to .gitignore are preserved; they will not be removed
Warning: using -x instead of -fd would delete ignored files. You probably don't want to do this.

- Lot of experimentation to mock the end points.
